        This is a 5-D system of equations that comes from http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20120830142005AA5dTyg.
        This example is quite a bit more computationally expensive than the others.

        Find values of w, x, y, and z that satisfy the following system of equations:

            A + 2B + 3C + 2D = 19.968
            -B + C = -1.15
            2B - 3C + D = 4.624
            3B + C + 2D + E = 22.312
            2D + E = 15.882

        First, I transform the system:

            A + 2B + 3C + 2D - 19.968 = 0
            -B + C + 1.15 = 0
            2B - 3C + D - 4.624 = 0
            3B + C + 2D + E - 22.312 = 0
            2D + E - 15.882 = 0

        I treat this as a minimization problem:

            min(sum(abs(A + 2B + 3C + 2D - 19.968) +
                    abs(-B + C + 1.15) +
                    abs(2B - 3C + D - 4.624) +
                    abs(3B + C + 2D + E - 22.312) +
                    abs(2D + E - 15.882)))

        Thus, we've found the optimal solution if the fitness is zero.

        The solution is A = 7.805, B = 1.895, C = 0.745, D = 3.069, E = 9.744.

        Warning: Stochastically solving a linear system is dumb. This is just a toy example.
